# ADcentral


## Summary

The Adcentral project is imitating sites like craigslist, ebay and etsy but ours is just the cat's pajamas. Designed by Jim, Alex, and Xavier
we added user-friendly features and additional security measures. Some features include a search function, the ability to delete
user profiles, and password verification, amongst a plethora of additional unlisted features you will find in our Adlister.
